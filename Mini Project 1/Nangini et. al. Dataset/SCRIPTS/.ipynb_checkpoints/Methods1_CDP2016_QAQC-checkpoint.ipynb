EPA's non road emissions model was used for off road vehicles Industrial emissions were estimated by looking at EPAs GHG reporting project data and comparing it to previously known information from utilities. Waste data was modeled using MSW and private collection data along with local landfill and incinerator emissions based on total waste. This was counted as a scope 3 emissions because none of these facilities are within the City of Philadelphia</td>\n",

The greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is calculated to 2.5 tonnes per capita in 2015, which can be compared to 2.6 tonnes per capita in 2014. Energy use for heating has decreased, which is due to energy efficiency measures and conversions (from oil to heat pumps).

The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment). Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand. Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services. All calculations in regards to primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions are made with the balancing program ECORegion (http://www.ecospeed.ch/).</td>\n",

This represents a change from our GHG emissions tonnage figure reported to CDP in 2015 and a slight decrease in the first 2013 Global GHC protocol compliant Baseline Emissions inventory.  Repeating the reasons for the change - between emissions reported in 2015 submission and now (due to move to a compliant BEI process), this is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport</td>\n",

The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations. Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures. Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts. Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records. For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In 2010, community-wide emissions with large industrial emitters had increased from 2005 by 24% while community-wide emissions without large industrial emitters increased by 41%.  There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.</td>\n",

This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints. The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chicago conducted a preliminary comparison using the existing 2010 and 2015 data to evaluate how community emissions have changed over the last five years. Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City. Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015. The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.</td>\n",

Because of limited documentation of the 2011 inventory, it is difficult to compare the two inventories. There has been a decrease in emissions since the 2005 inventory, even with a growing population. Contributing to decreases in reported community emissions are lower emissions from Nashville’s electric power source, TVA (their emissions per unit energy output declined by about 15% from 2005 to 2014), and more efficient vehicles (vehicle CO2e emissions per mile have decreased from about 450 to 350 grams/mile between 2005 and 2014). Meanwhile (although specific data is unavailable to demonstrate the quantity), building energy efficiency has been improving through both new and retrofit projects during this time frame.

However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%. Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period). Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs. This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008. A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.</td>\n",

Siemens prepared the initial report under an arrangement with C40 in 2012, and analyses the high-level changes between the two inventory years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "82   The Emission Inventory (MEI)  is updated within the Sustainable Energy Action Plan. It is based on the methodology and toolkit developed by ARPA ER (Environmental Protection Agency of Emilia-Romagna Region) within the instrument IPSI (Inventory of greenhouse gas emissions for the Covenant of Mayors - Italian version). The methodology was improved and adapted by a specific working group “Climate Plan”  at regional level including the main cities and Provinces. The background knowledge is based on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory realized by the Region with the support of ARPA ER, following standard estimation methodologies, internationally recognized (IPCC, CORINAIR). The MEI includes: direct emissions of the Municipality considered as an organization with its own consumptions; indirect emissions, generated by activities within the Municipal area estimated by ARPA ER as a breakdown of the regional inventory. According to the European and Regional methodology, activities within ETS (Emissions Trade System) are not taken into account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "169  In general the ICLEI protocol was followed, however in some cases data was not available in the same fashion or format as described in the protocol. Electricity, natural gas and steam usage was provided by the local utilities. Data related to onsite combustion of fuels was derived using the American Communities Surveys and allocated to Philadelphia based on population. Emissions from transportation was derived using the local regional planning commission's transportation model and EPA MOVES. EPA's non road emissions model was used for off road vehicles Industrial emissions were estimated by looking at EPAs GHG reporting project data and comparing it to previously known information from utilities. Waste data was modeled using MSW and private collection data along with local landfill and incinerator emissions based on total waste. This was counted as a scope 3 emissions because none of these facilities are within the City of Philadelphia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Stationary - Published central government datasets used for energy consumption and CO2 emissions from homes (residential buildings) and workplaces (commercial, industrial and government buildings and facilities). Mobile - The London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (in-house model) is used to calculate distances travelled from transport of people and goods by  road, railways, water-borne navigation, aviation, and off-road surface transport. National emissions factors are applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "103   Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) + SEAP Monitoring Report: Águeda’s SEAP holds a total carbon reduction potential of 33% by 2020, using 2002 as the reference year. The considered actions will also result in substantial economical benefits for the region’s citizens, companies and municipality, estimated at an average of 8 million Euros per year.An average investment of 3,3 million Euros per year is required to implement the actions included in the SEAP, but the bulk of this cost can be supported by external investment (public incentives, bank loans, ESCO models and the transaction of white certificates and carbon credits), which reduces to 1,2 million Euros per year the investment to be supported by the region’s citizens, companies and municipality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Scope 3 defined as the life cycle emissions of the energy use): Scope 1 & 3 emissions from district heating & cooling system and other in-boundary fuel combustion for heating; Scope 2 & 3 emissions of the house-hold electricity consumption within the community boundary; Scope 1 & 3 emissions of use of gas  e.g. cooking; Scope 2 & 3 emissions for electricity use in the transportation system (metro, commuter, train) within the community; Scope 1 & 3 emissions for the fuel consumption from road traffic, non-road vehicles and shipping, & scope 1 emissions from aviation (within the landing & take-off cycle, i.e. up to 915m). This means that scope 3 emissions from transport of inhabitants outside the community boundary is not included (but transport of non-inhabitants within the community boundary is). Emission from household waste incineration is embedded in the district heating emissions, since household waste is a source of energy used in district heating. Energy use for waste-water handling is included in the total community energy use. \\nEmission factors are collected from a report published by Swedish Environmental Research Institute Ltd. (IVL) in 2001 and Thermal Engineering Research Institute (Värmeforsk) in 2011. The reports are widely used and acknowledged. The global warming potentials are GWP100 from IPCC 2007, as recommended by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). Energy statistics are collected from different sources: district heating & gas statistics are collected from the companies; electricity statistics is compiled and collected from Statistics Sweden; emissions from road transport is modeled using an extensive emission model combined with a road model over Stockholm (includes a variety vehicles, speeds, road types etc) and non-road emissions are taken from Statistics Sweden; marine emissions within the community boundary are based on emissions & energy use presented in environmental reports from shipping companies and Ports of Stockholm.   \n",

       "121  The 2000-Watt society methodology is a concept of sustainable development that uses two indicators: Primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment). Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand. Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services. All calculations in regards to primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions are made with the balancing program ECORegion (http://www.ecospeed.ch/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "146  ICLEI’s methodology provides a systematic framework for local governments to track energy- and waste-related activities in the community, and to calculate the amounts of greenhouse gases produced by each activity and sector. The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations. Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures. Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts. Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records. For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "154  Chicago conducts regional GHG emissions inventories in-keeping with rigorous protocol and standards. New GHG methodologies and standards that were not available for previous analyses will be evaluated and adopted for future GHG emissions inventories, as-appropriate. The following GHG protocols were used in the 2010 Regional GHG Inventory: The LGOP for Greenhouse Gas Assessments developed by ICLEI, CAR, TCR and CARB (California Air Resources Board 2010a): This protocol includes methods for estimating emissions resulting from government buildings and facilities, government fleet vehicles, wastewater treatment and potable water treatment facilities, landfill and composting facilities, and other operations. This protocol was developed primarily for use by California local governments; although it contains methodologies for estimating emissions pertinent to community emissions sources. Further, this protocol can be modified for use outside of California, although in some cases, data sources or other references may need to be modified accordingly to local conditions or constraints. The USEPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2007 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2009a): The national inventory documentation includes standard methodology and emission factors for nationwide GHG emissions inventorying. The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006a): This document is the international standard for inventories and provides much of the baseline methodology used in the national and statewide emission inventories. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard developed by WRI and the WBCSD (World Resources Institute 2004): Although this is a protocol designed for use primarily by private corporations, it was one of the first documents to establish the principles and steps to developing a GHG inventory. This document has influenced the development of other types of GHG protocols, including those for municipal, government, and community-wide emissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

The largest sources of declines were in Industrial, Commercial, Institutional emissions and can likely be credited in no small part to efficiency improvements and the Province's closing of coal fired electricity generation.  The Province of Ontario made a commitment in 2002 to close all coal fired-electricity plants by 2015.  In 2014, the last coal fired electricity generation plant was closed in Ontario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

This drop in electricity consumption is mirrored in all the major municipalities in South Africa. There may well be data deficiency artefacts. The real reasons for this decrease and/or other trend that becomes apparent,will become clear as we become more thorough in quality data collection methods. Furthermore, to enhance our understand we will do bottom up data collection at a project level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "53   Community LDV emissions have decreased with continued increase in landfill gas capture efficiency. Also a decrease in overall stationary energy use: green building policies and improved energy efficiency contribute to this, but also a warmer winter season in 2015. Transportation Scope 1 emissions increased: fuel sales within region increased. Economic growth is one factor, but also USD-CAD exchange rate. Due to our proximity to US border (where fuel can be considerably less expensive), cross-border fuel-ups are significant. Unfavourable exchange rates correlate to decline in cross-border fuel purchasing behaviour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "136  Emissions resulting from transportation (specifically, the amount of gasoline and diesel) have increased since our last reported emissions inventory (2015 data). Additionally, we have improved some emissions data collection methods, which may have resulted in more accurate, but higher, emissions being recorded. We have also included natural gas used for transportation, which was not included in the previous inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "134  London's CO2 emissions decreased between 2013 and 2014. As of 2014 they are 16% lower than 1990 levels and expected to reach a 20% reduction in the 2015 GHG assessment (currently being finalised for publication later in 2017). This decline is due to decarbonisation of the national electricity grid, with a reduction in coal use and an increase in renewables share of the national energy mix. Gas usage has also decreased, due to energy efficiency improvements in homes and workplaces (including the roll-out of more efficient gas fired boilers) and a reduction in industrial activity within London. London's population continues to increase year on year and as of 2014 London's per capita emissions remain the UK's lowest at 4.4 tonnes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "125  The GHG emissions of Taipei City have been verified by third party, BSI Taiwan (British Standards Institution Taiwan), from 2005 to 2015 in 2016. The greenhouse gas emissions of Taipei City in 2015 were 12,117,400 metric tons. The greenhouse gas emissions of the City present a rising tendency in 2005-2008. The increasing tendency slowed down and began to decline since the 2008. There is no power plant in Taipei City jurisdiction; electricity usage is all dependent on the electricity grid from outside county. Although Taipei city’s electricity consumption in 2015 was lower 70 million KWh than that in 2014, the GHG emissions increased slightly in 2015 cause of the country’s electricity emission factor increased about 1.34%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

The 2009 and 2015 GHG emissions balance, point to a decrease in the emissions (by 22% and 26% respectively) - which indicates that Porto is half way of his ambitious target to 2020 – and these results are mainly  because of the decrease in the demand of fossil fuels (in mobility due to the Metro expansion) and “greener” national grid electricity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "118  Total emissions from the categories in Stockholm estimates at system boundaries have been reduced significantly over the past 10 years. Meanwhile, the population has grown by about 200 000 inhabitants. In Stockholm, it can be said that the reduction in per capita emissions by half will depend on the actual response, half of the population growth. The greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is calculated to 2.5 tonnes per capita in 2015, which can be compared to 2.6 tonnes per capita in 2014. Energy use for heating has decreased, which is due to energy efficiency measures and conversions (from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. Electricity use is however quite constant. The car traffic is constant in the last years even though the population has increased. However, there has been an increase in truck traffic. The overall greenhouse gas emissions from transportation is constant over the last years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "138  Emissions decreased from is 18.1 to 17.9 million tonnes between 2013 and 2014. This represents a change from our GHG emissions tonnage figure reported to CDP in 2015 and a slight decrease in the first 2013 Global GHC protocol compliant Baseline Emissions inventory.  Repeating the reasons for the change - between emissions reported in 2015 submission and now (due to move to a compliant BEI process), this is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "146  Natural gas consumption decreased in residential sector but increased in commercial and industrial sectors. Electricity consumption increased across the board. Even though electricity emissions factors decreased in 2014, the increase in electricity consumption offset improvements in emissions factors. On-road and rail activity increased. Solid waste generation decreased slightly due to increased diversion of waste from the landfill but waste water generation increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "148  In 2010, community-wide emissions with large industrial emitters had increased from 2005 by 24% while community-wide emissions without large industrial emitters increased by 41%.  There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.   \n",
       "149  The last GHG inventory performed for the Town of Blacksburg was in 2012. Over those three years decreased emissions from electric utility provider's fuel mix has resulted in decreased emissions in the residential, commercial, industrial and public sectors. Considering the population increase it is likely that the culture of electricity use may have also lead to decreased consumption. Transportation emissions have increased by 1.39% which is likely due to the 3.29% increase in population. Wastewater emissions are significantly lower because of errors made in the previous emission calculations.

       "154  Chicago conducted a preliminary comparison using the existing 2010 and 2015 data to evaluate how community emissions have changed over the last five years. Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City. Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015. The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.                                                                                                                             \n",

       "164  There was a small increase since the 2011 inventory, which was an incomplete inventory due to limited availability of data. Because of limited documentation of the 2011 inventory, it is difficult to compare the two inventories. There has been a decrease in emissions since the 2005 inventory, even with a growing population. Contributing to decreases in reported community emissions are lower emissions from Nashville’s electric power source, TVA (their emissions per unit energy output declined by about 15% from 2005 to 2014), and more efficient vehicles (vehicle CO2e emissions per mile have decreased from about 450 to 350 grams/mile between 2005 and 2014). Meanwhile (although specific data is unavailable to demonstrate the quantity), building energy efficiency has been improving through both new and retrofit projects during this time frame. LEED certification and Energy Star are examples of growing programs that help improve building energy efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "165  We submitted our 2014 baseline inventory last year as we had just completed. However, we subsequently learned more about our electricity mix and realized that our mix was not reflective of the eGrid mix and had much more nuclear and must less natural gas. We adjusted the inventory to reflect the right electricity emissions factor and that is the source of our decreased total inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "168  Combined City Municipal Operations and Palo Alto community emissions continue to decline. In 2016, overall City and Palo Alto GHG emissions were reduced an estimated 37% from 1990 levels, just under an additional 2% beyond 2015 reductions. Estimated City and community transportation related emissions declined an additional 5% from 2015 reductions, due to both a decrease in Vehicle Miles Travelled and changes in fleet composition. Natural gas emissions increased slightly from 2015, by approximately 1%, due in part to a colder fall and winter in 2016 than in 2015, which was warmer than average. Palo Alto Landfill Fugitive Emissions and Wastewater Process Emissions decreased due to efficiency measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "179  The total amount of GHGs emitted from the core emissions sources has declined 6% between 2008 and 2014, from 3.7 to 3.5 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent (CO2e).  However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%. Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period). Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs. This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008. A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "183  Considerando-se as Emissões de GEE por setor para o DF (emissões totais) no período de 2005-2012, as emissões têm aumentado em todos os setores avaliados. De acordo com a análise, os setores Energia e Resíduos apresentaram variação crescente ao longo de todos os períodos de análise. Para o setor IPPU, apenas a comparação 2005-2008 apresentou resultados menores do que o período anterior (2005-2007), com nova tendência de aumento nos demais intervalos subsequentes (devido à redução da produção de cimento em 2008 e retomada da produção nos anos seguintes). Já AFOLU apresentou intervalos irregulares de variação positiva e negativa ao longo do período, com valores negativos para os intervalos 2005-2006, 2005-2008, 2005-2009 e 2005-2010. No ano de variação positiva (2005-2007) as categorias mais representativas em emissões no setor AFOLU (Calagem e Emissões da queima de biomassa) também tiveram variação positiva nesse mesmo período.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

The greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is calculated to 2.5 tonnes per capita in 2015, which can be compared to 2.6 tonnes per capita in 2014. Energy use for heating has decreased, which is due to energy efficiency measures and conversions (from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. Electricity use is however quite constant.

The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment). Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand. Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services. All calculations in regards to primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions are made with the balancing program ECORegion (http://www.ecospeed.ch/).</td>\n",

This represents a change from our GHG emissions tonnage figure reported to CDP in 2015 and a slight decrease in the first 2013 Global GHC protocol compliant Baseline Emissions inventory.  Repeating the reasons for the change - between emissions reported in 2015 submission and now (due to move to a compliant BEI process), this is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport</td>\n",

       "      <td>In 2010, community-wide emissions with large industrial emitters had increased from 2005 by 24% while community-wide emissions without large industrial emitters increased by 41%.  There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chicago conducted a preliminary comparison using the existing 2010 and 2015 data to evaluate how community emissions have changed over the last five years. Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City. Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015. The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.</td>\n",

Because of limited documentation of the 2011 inventory, it is difficult to compare the two inventories. There has been a decrease in emissions since the 2005 inventory, even with a growing population. Contributing to decreases in reported community emissions are lower emissions from Nashville’s electric power source, TVA (their emissions per unit energy output declined by about 15% from 2005 to 2014), and more efficient vehicles (vehicle CO2e emissions per mile have decreased from about 450 to 350 grams/mile between 2005 and 2014). Meanwhile (although specific data is unavailable to demonstrate the quantity), building energy efficiency has been improving through both new and retrofit projects during this time frame. LEED certification and Energy Star are examples of growing programs that help improve building energy efficiency.</td>\n",

However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%. Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period). Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs. This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008. A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.</td>\n",

       "82   The Emission Inventory (MEI)  is updated within the Sustainable Energy Action Plan. It is based on the methodology and toolkit developed by ARPA ER (Environmental Protection Agency of Emilia-Romagna Region) within the instrument IPSI (Inventory of greenhouse gas emissions for the Covenant of Mayors - Italian version). The methodology was improved and adapted by a specific working group “Climate Plan”  at regional level including the main cities and Provinces. The background knowledge is based on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory realized by the Region with the support of ARPA ER, following standard estimation methodologies, internationally recognized (IPCC, CORINAIR). The MEI includes: direct emissions of the Municipality considered as an organization with its own consumptions; indirect emissions, generated by activities within the Municipal area estimated by ARPA ER as a breakdown of the regional inventory. According to the European and Regional methodology, activities within ETS (Emissions Trade System) are not taken into account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "169  In general the ICLEI protocol was followed, however in some cases data was not available in the same fashion or format as described in the protocol. Electricity, natural gas and steam usage was provided by the local utilities. Data related to onsite combustion of fuels was derived using the American Communities Surveys and allocated to Philadelphia based on population. Emissions from transportation was derived using the local regional planning commission's transportation model and EPA MOVES. EPA's non road emissions model was used for off road vehicles Industrial emissions were estimated by looking at EPAs GHG reporting project data and comparing it to previously known information from utilities. Waste data was modeled using MSW and private collection data along with local landfill and incinerator emissions based on total waste. This was counted as a scope 3 emissions because none of these facilities are within the City of Philadelphia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "103   Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) + SEAP Monitoring Report: Águeda’s SEAP holds a total carbon reduction potential of 33% by 2020, using 2002 as the reference year. The considered actions will also result in substantial economical benefits for the region’s citizens, companies and municipality, estimated at an average of 8 million Euros per year.An average investment of 3,3 million Euros per year is required to implement the actions included in the SEAP, but the bulk of this cost can be supported by external investment (public incentives, bank loans, ESCO models and the transaction of white certificates and carbon credits), which reduces to 1,2 million Euros per year the investment to be supported by the region’s citizens, companies and municipality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "121  The 2000-Watt society methodology is a concept of sustainable development that uses two indicators: Primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment). Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand. Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services.

The largest sources of declines were in Industrial, Commercial, Institutional emissions and can likely be credited in no small part to efficiency improvements and the Province's closing of coal fired electricity generation.  The Province of Ontario made a commitment in 2002 to close all coal fired-electricity plants by 2015.  In 2014, the last coal fired electricity generation plant was closed in Ontario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

This drop in electricity consumption is mirrored in all the major municipalities in South Africa. There may well be data deficiency artefacts. The real reasons for this decrease and/or other trend that becomes apparent,will become clear as we become more thorough in quality data collection methods. Furthermore, to enhance our understand we will do bottom up data collection at a project level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "53   Community LDV emissions have decreased with continued increase in landfill gas capture efficiency. Also a decrease in overall stationary energy use: green building policies and improved energy efficiency contribute to this, but also a warmer winter season in 2015. Transportation Scope 1 emissions increased: fuel sales within region increased. Economic growth is one factor, but also USD-CAD exchange rate. Due to our proximity to US border (where fuel can be considerably less expensive), cross-border fuel-ups are significant. Unfavourable exchange rates correlate to decline in cross-border fuel purchasing behaviour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "136  Emissions resulting from transportation (specifically, the amount of gasoline and diesel) have increased since our last reported emissions inventory (2015 data). Additionally, we have improved some emissions data collection methods, which may have resulted in more accurate, but higher, emissions being recorded. We have also included natural gas used for transportation, which was not included in the previous inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "134  London's CO2 emissions decreased between 2013 and 2014. As of 2014 they are 16% lower than 1990 levels and expected to reach a 20% reduction in the 2015 GHG assessment (currently being finalised for publication later in 2017). This decline is due to decarbonisation of the national electricity grid, with a reduction in coal use and an increase in renewables share of the national energy mix. Gas usage has also decreased, due to energy efficiency improvements in homes and workplaces (including the roll-out of more efficient gas fired boilers) and a reduction in industrial activity within London. London's population continues to increase year on year and as of 2014 London's per capita emissions remain the UK's lowest at 4.4 tonnes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "125  The GHG emissions of Taipei City have been verified by third party, BSI Taiwan (British Standards Institution Taiwan), from 2005 to 2015 in 2016. The greenhouse gas emissions of Taipei City in 2015 were 12,117,400 metric tons. The greenhouse gas emissions of the City present a rising tendency in 2005-2008. The increasing tendency slowed down and began to decline since the 2008. There is no power plant in Taipei City jurisdiction; electricity usage is all dependent on the electricity grid from outside county. Although Taipei city’s electricity consumption in 2015 was lower 70 million KWh than that in 2014, the GHG emissions increased slightly in 2015 cause of the country’s electricity emission factor increased about 1.34%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

The 2009 and 2015 GHG emissions balance, point to a decrease in the emissions (by 22% and 26% respectively) - which indicates that Porto is half way of his ambitious target to 2020 – and these results are mainly  because of the decrease in the demand of fossil fuels (in mobility due to the Metro expansion) and “greener” national grid electricity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "118  Total emissions from the categories in Stockholm estimates at system boundaries have been reduced significantly over the past 10 years. Meanwhile, the population has grown by about 200 000 inhabitants. In Stockholm, it can be said that the reduction in per capita emissions by half will depend on the actual response, half of the population growth. The greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is calculated to 2.5 tonnes per capita in 2015, which can be compared to 2.6 tonnes per capita in 2014. Energy use for heating has decreased, which is due to energy efficiency measures and conversions (from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. Electricity use is however quite constant. The car traffic is constant in the last years even though the population has increased. However, there has been an increase in truck traffic. The overall greenhouse gas emissions from transportation is constant over the last years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "138  Emissions decreased from is 18.1 to 17.9 million tonnes between 2013 and 2014. This represents a change from our GHG emissions tonnage figure reported to CDP in 2015 and a slight decrease in the first 2013 Global GHC protocol compliant Baseline Emissions inventory.  Repeating the reasons for the change - between emissions reported in 2015 submission and now (due to move to a compliant BEI process), this is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "146  Natural gas consumption decreased in residential sector but increased in commercial and industrial sectors. Electricity consumption increased across the board. Even though electricity emissions factors decreased in 2014, the increase in electricity consumption offset improvements in emissions factors. On-road and rail activity increased. Solid waste generation decreased slightly due to increased diversion of waste from the landfill but waste water generation increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "148  In 2010, community-wide emissions with large industrial emitters had increased from 2005 by 24% while community-wide emissions without large industrial emitters increased by 41%.  There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.   \n",
       "149  The last GHG inventory performed for the Town of Blacksburg was in 2012. Over those three years decreased emissions from electric utility provider's fuel mix has resulted in decreased emissions in the residential, commercial, industrial and public sectors. Considering the population increase it is likely that the culture of electricity use may have also lead to decreased consumption. Transportation emissions have increased by 1.39% which is likely due to the 3.29% increase in population. Wastewater emissions are significantly lower because of errors made in the previous emission calculations.

       "154  Chicago conducted a preliminary comparison using the existing 2010 and 2015 data to evaluate how community emissions have changed over the last five years. Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City. Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015. The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.                                                                                                                             \n",

       "164  There was a small increase since the 2011 inventory, which was an incomplete inventory due to limited availability of data. Because of limited documentation of the 2011 inventory, it is difficult to compare the two inventories. There has been a decrease in emissions since the 2005 inventory, even with a growing population. Contributing to decreases in reported community emissions are lower emissions from Nashville’s electric power source, TVA (their emissions per unit energy output declined by about 15% from 2005 to 2014), and more efficient vehicles (vehicle CO2e emissions per mile have decreased from about 450 to 350 grams/mile between 2005 and 2014). Meanwhile (although specific data is unavailable to demonstrate the quantity), building energy efficiency has been improving through both new and retrofit projects during this time frame. LEED certification and Energy Star are examples of growing programs that help improve building energy efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "165  We submitted our 2014 baseline inventory last year as we had just completed. However, we subsequently learned more about our electricity mix and realized that our mix was not reflective of the eGrid mix and had much more nuclear and must less natural gas. We adjusted the inventory to reflect the right electricity emissions factor and that is the source of our decreased total inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "168  Combined City Municipal Operations and Palo Alto community emissions continue to decline. In 2016, overall City and Palo Alto GHG emissions were reduced an estimated 37% from 1990 levels, just under an additional 2% beyond 2015 reductions. Estimated City and community transportation related emissions declined an additional 5% from 2015 reductions, due to both a decrease in Vehicle Miles Travelled and changes in fleet composition. Natural gas emissions increased slightly from 2015, by approximately 1%, due in part to a colder fall and winter in 2016 than in 2015, which was warmer than average. Palo Alto Landfill Fugitive Emissions and Wastewater Process Emissions decreased due to efficiency measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "179  The total amount of GHGs emitted from the core emissions sources has declined 6% between 2008 and 2014, from 3.7 to 3.5 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent (CO2e).  However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%. Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period). Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs. This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008. A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "183  Considerando-se as Emissões de GEE por setor para o DF (emissões totais) no período de 2005-2012, as emissões têm aumentado em todos os setores avaliados. De acordo com a análise, os setores Energia e Resíduos apresentaram variação crescente ao longo de todos os períodos de análise. Para o setor IPPU, apenas a comparação 2005-2008 apresentou resultados menores do que o período anterior (2005-2007), com nova tendência de aumento nos demais intervalos subsequentes (devido à redução da produção de cimento em 2008 e retomada da produção nos anos seguintes). Já AFOLU apresentou intervalos irregulares de variação positiva e negativa ao longo do período, com valores negativos para os intervalos 2005-2006, 2005-2008, 2005-2009 e 2005-2010. No ano de variação positiva (2005-2007) as categorias mais representativas em emissões no setor AFOLU (Calagem e Emissões da queima de biomassa) também tiveram variação positiva nesse mesmo período.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
