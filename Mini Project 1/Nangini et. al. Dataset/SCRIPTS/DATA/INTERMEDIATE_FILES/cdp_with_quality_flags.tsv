All data provided in this CDP submission is based on this report. The process includes: A baseline data collection was collected from the following 5 sectors. Residential Sector: disaggregated according to electrified and non-electrified by income category.  Commercial Sector: including retail and office buildings, tourism activities, education facilities, hospitals, and other non-industrial activities. Industrial Sector: disaggregated  into textiles, food and beverages, non-food manufacturing sub-sectors and other industrial activities. Local Government: all municipal operations, namely council buildings, street and traffic lights, water and wastewater treatment works and municipal vehicle fleet. Transport Sector: disaggregated into freight, private vehicle and public transport (bus,minibus taxi and train). The City's GHG account/inventory for its most recent State of Energy Report (Report released in 2015 based on 2012 data year) is based on the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Draft v2 (GPC). Emissions factors draw on those of the IPCC (web based and regularly updated) for South Africa, as well as Eskom for local electricity emissions factors. In the Cape Town GPC summary table provided, Scope 1 includes all emissions that physically take place within the Cape Town area. This includes liquid fuels consumed and coal. Even if that liquid fuel is moved out of the area, it is still accounted for as per point of sale. This scope includes the emissions from Ankerlig and Acacia power stations (Energy supplied to the grid - territorial); but these are removed in the final balance for Cape Town as per protocol (this is accounted for within national electricity production accounts of Eskom). Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity produced elsewhere in the country, but consumed in Cape Town. This column accounts for the majority of these emissions, but a small portion are recorded in Scope 3, reflecting that component of the emissions factor that relates to Transmission and distribution (i.e. from power station to municipal boundary; and amounting to 0.04 of the 1.03 emissions factor). Also included within the category energy industries is the municipal distribution losses.

CO2; CH4; N2O	19667128.0	15561157.0	4105971.0	Decreased	Due to the city mitigation actions, the city´s total GHG emissions have decreased compared to last year. It may be explained, among others factors, because of improvement of the mitigation measures in the Waste Sector: new technologies which have been implemented in order to reduce the volume of waste disposed in landfills. Even though, during 2014, the city recorded the longest heat wave in its history, which has led to an increase in energy consumption for air conditioning and in general a higher residential use of electricity; however, the reductions in the 2014 inventory were achieved by the diminution on natural gas consumption as well as the reductions done in the waste sector,  which in the end managed to diminish the impact of electricity energy subsector. Regarding transport sector, the City has sold little bit less fuel than last year, which is shown in a small decreases of the sector's emissions. Regarding the evolution of total GHG emissions in the period 2000 - 2014, an increase of 17% is observed. However, in the last 10 years (2005- 2014),the increase was 13%. After the implementation of the Action Plan, is relevant to compare the current level of emissions with those prior to the Plan, in 2008.

Recalculating 2003 and 2008 inventories to compare to the 2013 inventory shows that emissions have decreased by about 4% since the 2008 inventory, but have still increased by 10% since 2003. Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas. The residential sector increased electricity use and substantially increased natural gas use. The increase in natural gas is likely due to improved data quality, but seems to also correlate to the rise of hydraulic fracturing in the region.

Energy Heating and Cooling: The City of Toronto’s emissions factors for electricity and natural gas are updated annually and based on the National Inventory Reports (Environment Canada); however, the City of Toronto adds a 10% transmission loss to the NIR figure. Additionally, data is acquired from Toronto Hydro and Enbridge Gas on the electricity and natural gas consumption of the entire city, including residential, industrial, commercial, institutional etc...b. Transportation: Data are collected and standardized only for car and truck traffic through the City using four main sources: -truck traffic counts of over 2,000 intersections throughout the city from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division -accumulated traffic count data from years 1987 to 2009 from the City of Toronto’s Transportation Services Division --a Canadian standard developed by a Canadian consultant. The above traffic data is then used to calculate “vehicle kilometers traveled” (VKT) and emissions factors for vehicle types are applied to calculate total emissions from mobile sources. c. Waste: Tonnages of waste and approximate waste compositions are used in mass balance equations in the calculation of emissions from landfills.	CO2	18320966.0	16151019.0	2169947.0	Decreased	a.

The emissions for 2009 were 10,857 ktCO2e (our last emissions inventory). The emissions for 2013 were 10,955 ktCO2e (our most recent emissions inventory). The main driver of the increase was the increased emissions from the industrial processes and product use sector. Over the same timeframe, the population increased by 5.0 per cent and the GDP increased by 8.4 per cent. Subsequently, the emissions intensity by population decreased from 7.6 to 7.3 tCO2e per capita. Similarly the emissions intensity by GDP decreased from 160 to 149 tCO2e per million $NZ (2009/2010 price). Overall, the emissions intensity has reduced and there is evidence that emissions are decoupling from population and economic growth.	2015.0	1569900.0	81186000.0	NZD     New Zealand Dollar	2014.0	Statistics New Zealand	15.3	4894.0	79.0	(-36.815328, 174.741788)	(-40.900557, 174.885971)	2013.0	1.0		A

The first is the National repeal of the carbon price, which saw a higher percentage of supplied energy come from fossil fuels, increasing the emissions factor for the electricity grid despite the ACT’s own renewable energy coming online. The second was a below average minimum winter temperatures which are linked to more days requiring heating for households. The slight increase in demand for electricity, coupled with the increased emission factor saw a spike in emissions from the electricity sector compared to last year.	2016.0	400000.0	34866000000.0	AUD     Australian Dollar	2015.0	ABS, 2015	13.5	2358.0	578.0	(-35.3075, 149.1244)	(-25.274398, 133.775136)	2015.0	1.0		A

GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases. A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration. GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill.

During November 2015, the city reshaped and scoped calendar year 2012 emissions according to the new GPC BASIC framework to Compact of Mayors requirements.  The GPC expanded the scope of the verified 2012 inventory to report sources such as from natural gas leakage from the distribution system, district electricity, transmission and distribution electric losses, wastewater, agriculture/farming, ships and boats (non-ferry), off-road equipment and stationary sources.  This resulted in a higher emission number than originally verified by a third party.	CO2; CH4; N2O	5381687.0	4186111.0	1131352.0	Other	Methology Change: There was an increase in the emission number from inventory years 2010 to 2012.  The shift to the BASIC GPC framework during 2015 included categories that were otherwise excluded or not calculated during previous CDP reporting years.  Rather than rectify previous years, especially under the new GPC BASIC categories in which historic data is largely unavailable, CDP/COM reports will include these categories moving forward. However, to capture emission trends since 1990, the City will continue trending according to previously utilized ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol scopes in which case sectors such as Residential, Commercial/Industrial, Transportation (private, commercial, public/mass transit), Waste as well as Municipal emissions continues to decrease due to the City of San Francisco's progressive climate policies and commitment to implementing effective emission reduction strategies.	2015.0	864816.0	89205219000.0	USD     US Dollar	2015.0	Moody's Analytics and Bureau of Economic Analysis	10.4	121.0	142.0	(37.7749295, -122.4194155)	(37.09024, -95.712891)	2012.0	0.9880661956000042		A

The GPC consists of a compilation of guidelines for the preparation of municipal inventories of GHG emissions. The GPC 2012 shares the terminology of various international programs reporting of emissions, including the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the International Local Government GHG Emissions Analysis Protocol (IEAP-ICLEI) and the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Moreover, GPC 2012 converses directly with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. Aiming at a broad identification of emission sources and the establishment of a flow of information necessary for the completion of this study, four teams were created themes, being: stationary units, mobile units, and waste, industrial processes and product uses. The teams were grouped in four thematic workshops held between 26 and 27 June 2012 at the Administrative Center of the city of Goiania. During the implementation of these workshops were identified institutions and those responsible for sending the information necessary for calculations of emissions of greenhouse gases in the municipality.
For calculations of GHG emissions used the IPCC Inventory Software (IIS) version 2.0, a software developed and provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The data were placed on the software as a correspondence between GPC and IPCC categories, except in the case of the activities of electricity consumption (scope 2 emissions, the GPC category that has no corresponding IPCC - these emissions have been included in Section 5 – other). Another category that deserves observation refers to the disposal of solid waste in landfills. For this category we used the GPC, which allocates all expected emissions inventory in the year in which the waste is landfilled, IIS was not used for the calculation of this emission source."		2016320.0					2010.0	2173141.0	30131330.0	BRL     Brazilian Real	2010.0	IBGE - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistical	23.2	739.0	749.0	(-16.6868912, -49.2647943)	(-14.235004, -51.92528)	2010.0			D

Nevertheless, these figures do reflect Hamburg’s CO2e emissions quite accurately, because CH4, N2O etc. emissions only cause less than 4% of Hamburg’s overall CO2e emissions."	CO2	17755.0			Decreased	The most important factor responsible for the lower emissions is – despite a generally strong economic growth – a strong decline in the consumption of natural gas and petroleum products in the industry sector. However, a few industrial large-scale consumers in the field of petroleum and metal industry, whose production usually fluctuates, are responsible for a significant percentage of the consumption.	2014.0	1762791.0	102500000000.0	EUR     Euro	2014.0	Statistikamt Nord	8.8	755.0	6.0	(53.5510846, 9.9936818)	(51.165691, 10.451526)	2013.0			D

However, due to limitations associated with the data, year to year comparisons must be made with caution. In general, emissions over the past few years appear to be staying the same or potentially decreasing slightly despite population increases.  This is likely due to more efficient building construction, reduction in solid waste tonnages, increased recycling and organics diversion, and increased fuel efficiency standards.	2016.0	52898.0					11.0	11.8	90.0	(49.32699, -123.07328)	(56.130366, -106.346771)	2015.0	1.0	Replaced by CDP2017 data.

The sectors are similar to those used for the official Danish emission inventory (IPCC sectors), and include; collective power and heating, Indivitual heating, Mobile sources, Tranportation and machinery, Industrial processes, Solvents, Agriculture, Land use, and waste depositing and wastewater. Simplified generalizations of the equations used for emission calculations are used. These are based on the assumption that emissions of a given activity can be estimated using data descriptive for the size of the activity multiplied by an emission factor pr unit or activity. That is, the inventory is primarily based on scope-2 data on heat and power consumption and scope-1 data on road traffic. The method includes CO2-, CH4- and N2O-emission in the inventory.  As for the national inventories the calculation is built into several levels (Tiers) with increased requirements for municipalities regarding data quality. Each municipality may use different tiers for different sectors depending on the data available. Tier 1 is mainly based on the Danish national greenhouse gas inventory data using appropriate distribution keys, in most cases the municipality's share of total population, for a given activity into municipality level. Tier 2 is more detailed and includes emission factors used in the Danish national greenhouse gas inventories, while municipalities use their own activity data. At Tier 3, which is the most detailed level; municipalities use municipality specific emission factors and activity data.	CO2; CH4; N2O	1450358.0			Decreased	The CO2-emissions from the City of Copenhagen in 2015 was 11% lower than the emissions in 2014. The reduction in the emissions is primarily caused by more wind power i the power production in Copenhagen and in Denmark in general. For Denmark as a whole, one kilowatt-hour of electricity emitted an average of almost 29% less CO2 in 2015 than in 2014. This drop is partly attributable to higher wind production as well as more use of biomass in combined heat and power production.	2015.0	591481.0	308279000000.0	DKK     Danish Krone	2014.0	Danmarks Statistik, Statistics Denmark	8.0	86.0	9.0	(55.6760968, 12.5683371)	(56.26392, 9.501785)	2015.0			D

The cognitive foundation for producing the inventory is represented by the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, created by the Emilia-Romagna Region and ARPA Emilia-Romagna, according to the standard methods of estimation recognised on an international level (IPCC, CORINAIR). To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the “bottom‐up” method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels. In those cases where it was not possible to obtain accurate data, particularly concerning territorial data, a ""top-down"" approach was used, resorting to statistical processing of data aggregated at a provincial level. The overall picture of emissions of the Terre Estensi Association was built from the emissions inventory of the individual Municipalities of Ferrara, Masi Torello and Voghiera that constitute the Association, making the sum of the contributions of the three Municipalities. In line with the agreements within the Regional Work Group on Climate Plans, the year 2007 was chosen as a baseline reference year.

The greenhouse gas emissions in Stockholm is calculated to 2.5 tonnes per capita in 2015, which can be compared to 2.6 tonnes per capita in 2014. Energy use for heating has decreased, which is due to energy efficiency measures and conversions (from oil to heat pumps). Stockholm has a clear reduction of the energy supply per capita for heating sector. Electricity use is however quite constant.

The methodology is based on the final energy demand. Primary energy factors and GHG emission coefficients are according to the ecoinvent database (database with consistent and transparent, up-to-date Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data – www.ecoinvent.org/database/). The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment). Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand. Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data). However, the aim is to separately calculate and indicate the gray energy of net imported other goods and services. All calculations in regards to primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions are made with the balancing program ECORegion (http://www.ecospeed.ch/).

The reduction is consistent with the decrease in overall UK emissions from 2012 to 2013. The main drivers of the decrease in UK emissions in 2013 were a decrease in the use of coal and gas for electricity generation. This reflects the decrease in overall emissions for the UK during this period driven mainly by reductions in emissions from power stations, industrial combustion and passenger cars. The reduction from power stations is driven by change in the fuel mix used for electricity generation with a reduction in the amount of coal which is a carbon intensive fuel. The reduction in industrial combustion is largely driven by the closure or reduced activity of industrial plants, a large portion of which occurred during 2009 likely due to economic factors.	2014.0	1101360.0	84000000000.0	GBP     Pound Sterling	2014.0	"""Global city GDP 2014"".

There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEI’s protocol and guidance.	2014.0	27450.0	23000000.0	USD     US Dollar	2014.0	Solano EDC http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/bos/working_to_create_jobs/economic_studies.asp	21.0	13.0	26.0	(38.049365, -122.1585777)	(37.09024, -95.712891)	2010.0			D

Over those three years decreased emissions from electric utility provider's fuel mix has resulted in decreased emissions in the residential, commercial, industrial and public sectors. Considering the population increase it is likely that the culture of electricity use may have also lead to decreased consumption. Transportation emissions have increased by 1.39% which is likely due to the 3.29% increase in population. Wastewater emissions are significantly lower because of errors made in the previous emission calculations. Emissions from solid waste have also decreased roughly 4.4%.	2015.0	44215.0				this information is not available at this geographic scale	10.8	51.5	633.0	(37.2296, -80.4139)	(37.09024, -95.712891)	2015.0	1.0	Replaced by CDP2017 data.

Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicago’s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the region’s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City. Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the program’s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015. The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.	2015.0	2720546.0	563188000000.0		2014.0	Brookings Institution	9.4	606.0	181.0	(41.8781136, -87.6297982)	(37.09024, -95.712891)	2015.0	1.0	Replaced by CDP2017 data.

Because of limited documentation of the 2011 inventory, it is difficult to compare the two inventories. There has been a decrease in emissions since the 2005 inventory, even with a growing population. Contributing to decreases in reported community emissions are lower emissions from Nashville’s electric power source, TVA (their emissions per unit energy output declined by about 15% from 2005 to 2014), and more efficient vehicles (vehicle CO2e emissions per mile have decreased from about 450 to 350 grams/mile between 2005 and 2014). Meanwhile (although specific data is unavailable to demonstrate the quantity), building energy efficiency has been improving through both new and retrofit projects during this time frame. LEED certification and Energy Star are examples of growing programs that help improve building energy efficiency.	2015.0	678889.0	106695000000.0	USD     US Dollar	2014.0	MSA Data (not county only) from US DOC's BEA http://bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=10&isuri=1&7003=200&7035=-1&7004=naics&7005=-1&7006=34980&7036=-1&7001=2200&7002=2&7090=70&7007=2014&7093=levels#reqid=70&step=10&isuri=1&7003=200&7004=naics&7035=-1&7005=-1&7006=34980&7001=2200&7036=-1&7002=2&7090=70&7007=2014&7093=levels	15.1	1367.0	182.0	(36.1627, -86.7816)	(37.09024, -95.712891)	2014.0	1.0	Replaced by CDP2017 data.

CO2; CH4; SF6	5222000.0	5150000.0	72000.0	Decreased	The total amount of GHGs emitted from the core emissions sources has declined 6% between 2008 and 2014, from 3.7 to 3.5 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent (CO2e).  However, Seattle’s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%. Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period). Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs. This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattle’s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattle’s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008. A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Light’s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.	2015.0	662400.0	300827000000.0	USD     US Dollar	2014.0	US Dept Commerce for Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue region	11.0	3692.0	15.0	(47.6062095, -122.3320708)	(37.09024, -95.712891)	2012.0	1.0	S1 derived from TOT - S2 in CDP2016 dataset	C
